A program project generally involves the organized efforts of relatively large groups, members of which are conducting research projects designed to elucidate the various aspects or components of this objective. Each research project is usually under the leadership of an established investigator. The grant can provide support for certain basic resources used by these groups in the program, including clinical components, the sharing of which facilitates the total research effort. A program project is directed toward a range of problems having a central research focus, in contrast to the usually narrower thrust of the traditional research project. Each project supported through this mechanism should contribute or be directly related to the common theme of the total research effort. These scientifically meritorious projects should demonstrate an essential element of unity and interdependence, i.e., a system of research activities and projects directed toward a well-defined research program goal."

This special program, authorized under Superfund legislation, is for a broadly based, multi-disciplinary research effort which must include biomedical research components and which may include research components related to engineering, hydrogeology, ecology and epidemiology so long as they are linked to basic biomedical science. Each research project is generally under the leadership of an established investigator. The grant can provide support for certain basic resources used by the groups in the program (cores), including an administrative structure for effective coordination."
